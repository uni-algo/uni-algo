Read list_and_info.txt first for details.

Unicode algorithms are written in most generic way so they are compatible with every toaster.
The algorithms can be compiled in C or C++ mode when compiled in C++ then most functions
are templates that can be used with most C++ iterators.
The algorithms use C99 syntax rules with optional C++ templates and many restrictions.

This means:
1. Any dependencies are not allowed so none of C/C++ functions can be used.
2. Memory allocations are not allowed.
3. Pointers can be used only for return parameters.
5. Any pointer casts are not allowed so a violation of strict aliasing is not possible.
6. Internal type type_codept must be used for all code point calculations,
Unicode properties etc. anything related to a code point.
7. Internal types type_char8, type_char16, type_char32 can be used only to
suppress warnings by casts any other usage of this types are not allowed.
8. size_t is allowed but cannot be used for any code point calculations.
9. int and bool are allowed but cannot be used for any calculations at all.
10. unsigned char is allowed and it is the only type that can be used together with type_codept.
11. type_codept, unsigned char and unsigned short are the only types that can be used for
Unicode data tables and this is the only place where unsigned short must be used.
12. char* is allowed when it represents an ASCII string for example code point names
but char type is not allowed (for the future at the moment char is not used anywhere).
13. Any other types are not allowed.
14. sizeof is not allowed.
15. enum is not allowed.
16. C++ stuff must be protected with #ifdef __cplusplus
17. #ifdef __cplusplus can be used inside a function only if there is no other way
to make the function compatible with C and C++ (there is no such places for now).
18. Preprocessor macros are not allowed (except 1 that is used in C mode only see internal_stages.h).
19. Preprocessor defines are allowed.
20. Internal preprocessor defines must be undefined at the end of every module.
21. Even though low-level has access to assert (thru uaix_assert) it must be used only for
testing and debugging aid so asserts are discouraged and the code must never rely on asserts.
255. Probably there are other dangerous things that you can do then it is not allowed too.
0. These restrictions do not apply to a wrapper.

Everything inside folder impl is called low-level or impl-level and must follow these restrictions.
Higher level that implements functions from the low-level is called wrapper-level and
it is wrapper-level responsibility to implement the functions properly and provide them for user-level.
That means all input/output parameters checks etc. must be done on wrapper-level and not on the low-level.

TLDR

Full list of types that allowed:
For code point related stuff: type_codept, unsigned char, unsigned short
For techical stuff: size_t, bool, int
To suppress warnings: type_char8, type_char16, type_char32
To represent ASCII string: char*

Full list of keywords that allowed inside functions:
return, true, false, const, if, else, for, do, while, continue, break, struct, constexpr.
switch, default, case are allowed but avoid if possible.
